# War Card Game

This project is a React web application that recreates the classic War card game using the Deck of Cards API. The application leverages various React hooks such as `useContext`, `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer` for efficient state management. Additionally, keyframes are used to animate some of the images and titles for a more dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **Deck of Cards API Integration**: The game uses the Deck of Cards API to shuffle and draw cards.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useContext`, `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer` hooks for state management.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The project is organized into separate components, each in its own folder with corresponding CSS files for easier maintenance and styling.
- **Animations**: Keyframe animations are added to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Game Logic**: Implements the logic for the War card game, including scoring and handling special conditions like "war".

## Project Structure

- **Components**: Each React component is placed in its own folder along with a CSS file for styling.
- **Data Folder**: Contains API-related files.
- **Organized Codebase**: The project is structured to facilitate easy debugging and styling changes.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the application with `npm start`.
